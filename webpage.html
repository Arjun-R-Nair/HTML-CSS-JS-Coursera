                In antiquity, a paragraph often was a single thoughtâ€”and often a single sentence, usually a very long
                one.
                Writers today, however, tend not to go on the way classical authors did. In academic writing, most
                paragraphs include at least three sentences, though rarely more than ten.

                A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think
                about
                paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports
                one
                central, unified idea.
