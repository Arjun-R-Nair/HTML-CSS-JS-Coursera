            <h3>Item 1</h3>
            A paragraph is a brief piece of writing that's around seven to ten sentences long. It has a topic sentence
            and supporting sentences that all relate closely to the topic sentence. ... Topic sentence - it has the main
            idea. Supporting sentence - details that relate to and support the topic sentence.

            <h3>Item 2</h3>
            In antiquity, a paragraph often was a single thoughtâ€”and often a single sentence, usually a very long one.
            Writers today, however, tend not to go on the way classical authors did. In academic writing, most
            paragraphs include at least three sentences, though rarely more than ten.

            <h3>Item 3</h3>
            A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about
            paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one
            central, unified idea.
